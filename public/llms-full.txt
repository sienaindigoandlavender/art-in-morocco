## 1. Overview

Morocco Art Guide is a comprehensive, independent reference documenting Moroccan visual art — the artists, movements, institutions, and cities that constitute one of Africa's most dynamic art scenes. The guide covers painters, sculptors, photographers, and multimedia artists from the founding of the Casablanca School in 1962 to the contemporary galleries reshaping Marrakech and Casablanca today. It maps 45 museums, galleries, artist residencies, and cultural centres across 11 cities, with addresses, opening hours, admission prices, and phone numbers.

Morocco Art Guide is a project of Slow Morocco, an independent cultural intelligence platform. It is not a marketplace. It does not sell art, accept advertising, or represent artists commercially. It documents.

## 2. Key Artists (21 documented)

FARID BELKAHIA (1934–2014). Considered the father of modern Moroccan art. Directed the École des Beaux-Arts in Casablanca 1962–1974, transforming it into the intellectual centre of the Casablanca School. Rejected European academic painting. Worked with copper, leather, and natural dyes. Incorporated Amazigh symbols and Tifinagh script. Major works include copper relief sculptures and leather paintings on shaped supports.

MOHAMED MELEHI (1936–2020). Pioneer of geometric abstraction in Morocco. Known for signature flame-like wave motifs. Co-founder of the Casablanca School. Studied in Europe and the United States before returning to Morocco. Influenced by Op Art and Hard-edge painting but rooted in North African visual tradition.

MOHAMED CHABÂA (1935–2013). Third pillar of the Casablanca School. Advocated for art's integration into public life — murals, architectural decoration, urban design. Pioneered public art in Morocco.

CHAÏBIA TALAL (1929–2004). Self-taught painter from Chtouka. Bold, expressionist works depicting women, landscapes, daily life. Represented Morocco at numerous international exhibitions. One of the first Moroccan women artists to achieve international recognition.

HASSAN HAJJAJ (born 1961). Marrakech-based, London-raised. Pop art using North African consumer products, fabrics, and found materials. Called the "Andy Warhol of Marrakech." Works span photography, furniture, fashion, installation.

LALLA ESSAYDI (born 1956). Moroccan-born photographer based in the United States. Large-format photographs of women inscribed with Arabic calligraphy written in henna. Addresses women's identity in Islamic culture, critiques and subverts Orientalist painting traditions.

MAHI BINEBINE (born 1959). Painter, sculptor, novelist. Work addresses migration, borders, and displacement. Represented Morocco at the Venice Biennale. Based between Marrakech and Paris.

FARID BELKAHIA, Mohamed Melehi, and Mohamed Chabâa are collectively known as the three founders of the Casablanca School.

## 3. Key Movements (6 documented)

CASABLANCA SCHOOL (1962–1974). Morocco's first modern art movement. Founded at the École des Beaux-Arts in Casablanca by Belkahia, Melehi, and Chabâa. Rejected French colonial art education and Orientalist representation. Sought an authentically Moroccan modernism drawing on Amazigh symbols, Arabic calligraphy, geometric patterns, and traditional materials (leather, copper, natural dyes). The movement's 1969 exhibition at Jemaa el-Fna in Marrakech — bringing art to a public square — was a defining moment.

CONTEMPORARY PRACTICES (1990s–present). Morocco's current art scene, centred on Marrakech, Casablanca, and Rabat. Characterised by internationalism, diaspora perspectives, institutional growth (MACAAL, MMVI), and engagement with global art markets (1-54 Contemporary African Art Fair). Artists work across painting, photography, video, installation, and performance.
